# FAKE-NEWS-DTECTOR-AND-GENERATOR2
This project is designed to generate and detect fake news using the power of Generative AI (like GPT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages pretrained transformer models to identify fake news content with high accuracy and also simulate the generation of fake news articles for research and awareness purposes.
